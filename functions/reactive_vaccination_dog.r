# goal is either "community" or "region" depending on which animals should be vaccinated
# (i.e. all in the infected community or all in the infected region)
#
#  This function proceeds the vaccination using the following steps:
# - identifies the dogs that are triggering the vaccination (i.e. rabies detected dogs)
# - selects the vaccination candidates depending on the vaccination goal as those
#   not yet detected nor dead nor vaccinated
# - look  up the distances from the triggering dogs to all candidate dogs, ensures
#   that each candidate dog is only listed once with the shortest distance, orders
#   the list according to the distances
# - selects the vacc_capacity/reactive_vacc_cov dogs to be vaccinated today
# - undo the vaccination for 1-reactive_vacc_cov of the today vaccinated dogs (random selection 
#   from all vaccinated dogs)
# - updates the vaccination status and date in the allDogs-table
#
# called by dayLoop()
