# OzRab
Agent-based rabies simulation model for free roaming domestic dogs; originally developed for the Northern Pensinsula Area (NPA), Australia; can be adapted to any dog population

The here presented version of the model has been set up for 5 communities within one of the regions. This can be altered to suit the users region/community. The user needs to have Rdata files (in the scenario/.../Dogs folder) with coordinates of dog owning houses and to produce a distance matrix from these describe the distance between every combination of dog owning house (see distance_marix in the scenario folder) which is done in the function initialize_simulation. The model runs from the RunScript file (located in the scenario/GitHUb_anonymized directory) in which the user can define control and infection parameters. The model does produce epi maps visually showing the spread of rabies within the community. However, due to omitted coordinates of the households (confidentiality reason) these functions have been commented out in the given code and can be uncommented when data with coordinates is being used (see comment "adpat standardSummary"). Each function in the model has an explanatory paragraph at the beginning of the code.
